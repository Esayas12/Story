===============


We can use the gateway ip as dns for local. Network team will give the DNS IP. The DNS ip can be used for the primary 
and the secondary 
Data types:strings, byte, long,float, double, int,... Authenticated users are activated users 
	Under the prdt u can publish which api u want to expose
	We will do staging into the sandbox. sandbox is our catalaog. After staging it, since everything is done u can publish it 
	when u publish the api prodt, is going to be pushed to the gateway as well
We test our apis in assemble

We can also create specific/custom Dp services in DP. When api calls land on DP either from mobile apps/web apps, DP services
are created in the form of apis. All the api calls we are going to make are DP URLs

https://192.168.159.201/esucraft/sb/geekservice/inputpath

We are going to integrate apicmgt and portal
	portal mgmt address is loadbalancer of portal(192.168.159.175)/standalone ip/dns 
	we are going to check port openings:
		from apimgt: netspect host 192.168.159.175 port 22
		from dev portal: cat </dev/tcp/192.168.159.152/22
		from dev portal: cat </dev/tcp/192.168.159.152/443 
	from dev portal: echo </dev/tcp/192.168.159.152/443
	self telnet on dev portal: echo </dev/tcp/192.168.159.175/22 

U will find the pub key when u enable dev portal in apicmgt.
  After integrating 		
** We can manage the version in api but not in DP
